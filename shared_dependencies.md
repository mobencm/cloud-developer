1. React: All the JavaScript files will share the React library as a dependency for creating and managing the UI components.

2. ReactDOM: The "src/index.js" file will use ReactDOM for rendering the main App component into the root DOM node.

3. App Component: The "src/App.js" file will export the main App component which will be imported and used in "src/index.js".

4. Header, Footer, MainContent, Sidebar Components: These components will be exported from their respective files and imported into "src/App.js" to be used in the main App component.

5. CSS Styles: The "src/styles/App.css" file will be imported into "src/App.js" to apply styles to the App component.

6. Root DOM Element: The "public/index.html" file will contain a root DOM element with an id of "root" which will be used by "src/index.js" to render the App component.

7. Component Function Names: Each component file will have a function with the same name as the component (e.g., Header, Footer, MainContent, Sidebar) that returns the JSX for that component.

8. Message Names: If the components share common messages or alerts, these would be defined as constants and shared across the components.

9. Data Schemas: If the components share common data structures or types, these would be defined as schemas and shared across the components.

10. State and Props: If the components share common state or props, these would be passed down from the parent App component to the child components (Header, Footer, MainContent, Sidebar).
